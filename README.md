I ran into some (not too intrusive) technical problems that I could not figure out: I somehow managed to generate 1 Million rows / columns, and it slowed the program for me. I then could not delete these columns or rows no matter what I tried.
I think I am over thinking the 2nd bonus, so I am leaving it incomplete for now. I made two attempts at solving it: using formulas and using a pivot table. I struggled to find a formula that worked for finding the median of "canceled" + "failed".
